Python command-line utility for Windows for moving directories. Can move from one drive to another. Requires PyWin32. 

Continues moving the directory even if some files fail, depending on what the user enters when prompted.

I don't remember writing this, but I probably did. =P

usage: mv &lt;origin> &lt;destination>
